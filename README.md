# Chicago Rent Alpha Predictor

End-to-end CMSE 492 final project exploring what drives **ZIP-level rent outperformance**
("alpha") in the Chicago metro area.

The goal is to:
- Engineer economic, structural, lifestyle, and safety features at the ZIP × month level
- Train and compare linear vs tree-based models (Ridge, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest)
- Identify which neighborhoods are projected to outgrow the metro baseline, and why

How to Run the Project
This project contains two primary Jupyter notebooks that should be executed in order.

1. Setup Environment (Recommended)
Create and activate a virtual environment:
python -m venv .venv

Activate the environment:

macOS / Linux:

source .venv/bin/activate


Windows:

.\.venv\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

(Optional) Register the kernel so it appears in Jupyter:
python -m ipykernel install --user --name cmse492_project --display-name "Python (cmse492_project)"

Launch Jupyter:
python -m notebook


2. Run the Notebooks in Order
Notebook 1 — 01_eda_augmented.ipynb
This notebook:

Loads Zillow rent data and external datasets (crime, permits, demographics).
Cleans and merges all sources into a ZIP–month panel dataset.
Generates engineered features such as momentum, rolling statistics, interactions, and amenity proxies.
Outputs the final modeling dataset to:

data/processed/chicago_augmented_12m.csv

Run this notebook first, because Notebook 2 depends on the processed output.

Notebook 2 — 02_models_advanced.ipynb
This notebook:

Loads the cleaned dataset created in Notebook 1.
Defines the modeling feature set and target variable (12-month rent alpha).
Trains three models: Ridge, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Performs hyperparameter tuning (RandomizedSearchCV).
Evaluates models on a 2023–2024 time-series test split.
Generates figures including:

Feature importance
Model comparison
Gentrification hotspot map
Rent prediction distribution



Figures are saved automatically to:
figures/


3. Reproducibility Notes

All file paths are relative to the project root.
The notebooks use a root-finder block to avoid path issues in different environments.
Running the notebooks from the project root or from within notebooks/ both work.

Data Sources

This project integrates multiple public datasets related to housing, crime, demographics, and development activity in Chicago:

🔹 Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI)

Source: Zillow Research
URL: https://www.zillow.com/research/data/

Provides monthly ZIP-level rent estimates for the Chicago metropolitan area.

Used to compute the target variable: 12-month forward rent growth relative to the metro average (“rent alpha”).

🔹 Chicago Crime Data

Source: City of Chicago Open Data Portal — Crimes (2001–Present)
URL: https://data.cityofchicago.org

Includes geocoded crime reports generated by the Chicago Police Department.

Monthly counts were aggregated and smoothed using 12-month rolling sums.

🔹 Chicago Building Permit Data

Source: Chicago Data Portal — Building Permits
URL: https://data.cityofchicago.org

Records new construction and renovation permits.

Used as a proxy for neighborhood construction activity and redevelopment intensity.

🔹 Demographic and Socioeconomic Indicators

Source: U.S. Census Bureau (ACS 5-year estimates)

Provides ZIP-level income, poverty, vacancy rate, and housing age.

Used to engineer structural features and amenity interactions.

🔹 Engineered Lifestyle & Amenity Proxies

Because APIs such as Yelp could not be used within project constraints, lifestyle indicators were approximated using:

Housing age

Transit access measures

Nightlife intensity (constructed using demographic + spatial heuristics)

Hipster index and wellness index (engineered features)

These proxies were validated through exploratory correlation and feature importance analysis.
